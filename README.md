# Campus Study Spot Reservation System (CP476)

## Project Overview
A full-stack web application that lets students reserve study/work spots around campus (e.g., library desks, group rooms, quiet pods). The system prevents conflicting bookings and provides visibility into availability and peak usage times.

## Target Users
- Students (primary)
- Admin/staff (manage spots and policies)

## Primary Workflow (CRUD)
- View available study spots
- Create a reservation
- View reservation details
- Edit or cancel a reservation
- Prevent conflicting reservations (server-side validation)

## Planned Features
### Must Have
- Spot listing with availability
- Make and cancel reservations
- Conflict prevention (no overlapping reservations)
- Input validation (date/time rules)

### Should Have
- “My Reservations” page
- Admin CRUD for study spots (add/edit/remove)
- Basic usage analytics (peak hours)

### Could Have
- “Busy times” visualization (based on historical reservation counts)
- Filters (building, quiet/group, capacity)

## Tech Stack (Course Technologies)
- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Back-end: Node.js (or PHP)
- Database: Relational DB (e.g., MySQL)

## Repo Structure (Planned)
- `/docs` (wireframes, milestone PDFs, screenshots)
- `/frontend`
- `/backend`
- `/database`

## How to Run (Milestone 01)
Not implemented yet (planning milestone).
